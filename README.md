# Recipe API

## Functional Endpoints

- /api/users
> Gets a list of all users
- /api/register
> Create a new user, with a user object in post request body. Shape `{ UserID:0, UserName:string, Email:string, Password:string }`. ID is optional.

## ToDo Endpoints

- Add recipe
- Edit recipe
- Delete user
- Delete recipe
- Give rating
Some more stuff? I don't remember.

#### Todo:

- Figure out all endpoints required.
- Add JWT for IDing users? (Optional, can just send plaintext ID, but would be nice)
